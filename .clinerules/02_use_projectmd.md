ALWAYS refer to the project.md file. If it doesn't exist in the project's folder, create it.

The Project.md file should have the following structure:

# Project title
**Current version**: (Number here, like 0.01, 0.14, etc.)
**Description**: Short, concise, but descriptive intro to the project/explanation of what it's about. One to three sentences.
**Latest change**: (Something like "removed illegal character from line 192", "added file requester", etc.)
